=head1 NAME

Software::GenoScan - Software for pre-miRNA discovery in genomic sequences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Software::GenoScan qw(runGenoScan);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 BACKGROUND

This module is the implementation of GenoScan, a computational method for prediction of
pre-miRNAs in genomic DNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that act
as post-transciprional regulators of gene expression. They are initially transcribed from
intergenic or intronic DNA as primary miRNAs with a characteristic hairpin secondary
structure, which are processed into shorter precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The precursors
are exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved to liberate the mature miRNA, which is incorporated
into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC molecule then binds to specific
target mRNAs by complementary base-pairing between the mature miRNA and the 3' UTR of the
mRNA. This either prevents mRNA translation to protein or mediates mRNA degradation.

=head2 OUTLINE

GenoScan takes genomic DNA as input, and optional sequence annotation used for filtering.
Sequences that pass the filters are segmentized into 200 nt windows with 20 nt overlaps 
and folded with RNAfold. Hairpins are then extracted from the folded sequences based on a 
a number of sequence and structure criteria. Finally, the extracted hairpins are classified
as miRNAs or non-miRNAs using a logistic regression model trained on human datasets. See
the publication for a detailed description of the algorithm and its evaluation. The
publication reference can be found in L</"SEE ALSO">.

=head2 ARGUMENTS

Following installation, GenoScan can be run from the terminal using the genoscan.pl script
supplied in the t/ folder. The command should be in this form

C<perl genoscan.pl [Options]>

GenoScan can be run in four different modes. Depending on the mode, different command line
arguments must be given. The next section gives general options that apply to several or all
modes, while the following sections give options specific to each mode.

=head3 GENERAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<-m value>

Specifies the GenoScan running mode. Possible values are C<genome>, C<classify>, C<benchmark>
and C<retrain>. The default mode is C<genome>, which is used to scan a whole genome or part
thereof for pre-miRNAs. GenoScan can also be used to classify a set of hairpins as miRNAs
or non-miRNAs, without first extracting hairpins from a genome. This is done in C<classify>
mode. To facilitate comparison with other methods, the C<benchmark> mode enables leave-one-out
cross valdiation on datasets containing positive, negative and genomic hairpins. This generates
a table with performance measures similar to those in the publication. Finally, the C<retrain>
mode is used to retrain the regression model on custom datasets.

=item C<-t value>

The probability threshold used for hairpin classification. When the regression model evaluates
the hairpins, it calculates a probability that the hairpin is a miRNA. By setting a threshold
for this probablity, it is possible to adjust the stringency of classification. The value should
be between 0 and 1 (default: 0.5). Only hairpins with a probability above threshold will qualify as miRNA
candidates by GenoScan. According to the evaluation in the publication, performance peaks around
probability treshold 0.5-0.6. Higher stringency will give higher specificity, but lower sensitivity.

=item C<-r value>

A file containing regression model coefficients to use instead of the default ones. The value should
be the file name including path. The format of the file is as follows:

	(Intercept) 10.5280777518279
	stem_len    0.0500355477383941
	loop_size   0.320050551436161
	mfe_nor     -6.61410292089138
	prop_gap    -17.1624469004961
	prop_bulge  4.80460097209541
	prop_wobble -3.18891064122477
	gc_content  -8.89487058546057
	PPP         -4.61085343984701
	UUU         -9.76065756139253
	UUP         -26.0725578749436
	PPU         -27.0092130076774
	PUP         -11.7589439172359
	UPP         23.1858571677642

The coefficient name appears at the beginning of each row, followed by a tab and the value.

=item C<-o value>

The output directory to which the results of GenoScan will be written. This option is mandatory.

=item C<-s value>

Species abbreviation, which determines the parameters used for extraction and classification.
The initial version of GenoScan has only been trained on human, so the only possible value
is C<hsa>. Training on multiple species is planned as a future development.

=item C<-l value>

In addition to filter predictions by probability, GenoScan also supports filtering by low sequence
complexity. A sequence with low complexity has long streches of the same nucleotide, or repeats
of a nucleotide segment. For this to work, low-complexity regions need to be masked by lower case
letters. Two possibilities are to downloaded masked genomic sequences from NCBI RefSeq database, or
mask custom sequences with RepeatMasker. To filter GenoScan predictions by low complexity, a value
between 0 and 100 should be specified to the C<-l> option, indicating the percentage of nucleotides
that are allowed to be masked. The default is 100, which allows the entire hairpin sequence to be
masked.

=item C<-v>

This option specifies if GenoScan should be verbose, i.e. continuously report on its progress during
a run.

=item C<-h>

This option causes argument documentation to be printed to the terminal.

=back

=head3 GENOME MODE ONLY

=over 4

=item C<-d value>

Directory where genomic sequences in FASTA format are located, in which to search for miRNAs. The value
should be the path to the folder, including the folder name.

=item C<-e value>

Directory where genomic annotation files in GBS format are located. This argument is optional and will
tell GenoScan to ignore annotated regions (except miRNAs) when searching for miRNAs.

=item C<-i value>

Name of a file containing regions to include when searching for miRNAs. Regions outside of those
specified will not be searched. The format of the file should be as follows:

	chr1:1000000-2000000
	chr3:1500000-1700000
	chr9:500000-1500000

=item C<-f value>

A file containing hairpin extraction parameters to use instead of the default ones. The value should
be the file name including path. The format of the file is as follows:

	SEQ_LEN_MIN    = 40
	CG_COMP_MIN    = 0.2
	CG_COMP_MAX    = 0.8
	TR_SIG_MAX     = 5
	STEM_LEN_MIN   = 20
	LOOP_LEN_MAX   = 20
	STEM_BP_PR_MIN = 0.5
	UP_STR_NOR_MAX = 0.35
	UP_LEN_NOR_MAX = 0.35

=item C<-j value>

Indicates that GenoScan should start processing at a given step. The value should be between 2 and 5
and allows the run to start working on existing data, rather than starting from the beginning. The
steps of genoscan include (1) read annotation filters, (2) seqmentize and fold input sequences,
(3) extract hairpins, (4) classify harirpins and (5) write miRNA candidates to output file.

=back

=head3 CLASSIFY MODE ONLY

=over 4

=item C<-c value>

File in FASTA format containing hairpins to classify as miRNAs or non-miRNAs. The C<classify> mode
allows hairpins to be classified directly, without first extracting them from genomic sequences.

=back

=head3 BENCHMARK AND RETRAIN MODE ONLY

=over 4

=item C<-p value>

File containing the positive dataset, which consists of known miRNAs in FASTA format.

=item C<-n value>

File containing the negative dataset, which consists of pseudo-hairpins in FASTA format.

=item C<-g value>

File containing the genomic dataset, which consists of extracted genomic hairpins in FASTA format.
This dataset is only used during benchmarking.

=item C<-a value>

Custum path to R script used for benchmarking or retraining. The scripts are part of the GenoScan distribution
and are located in the scripts/ directory. If GenoScan is run from the t/ directory, the C<-a> option need not
be set.

=back

=head2 OUTPUT

The output generated by GenoScan depends on the mode specified. For C<genome> and C<classify>,
GenoScan generates two final output files (in step 5): a list of pre-miRNA candidates in FASTA format
and a log file with a summary of the run. The header of each miRNA candiadate starts with the hairpin ID,
followed by species abbreviation and the loci in the genome where the hairpin is located. The hairpins
appearing in this file are the final list of candidates that pass the probability threshold and
low-complexity filtering.

In C<benchmark> mode, the list of candidates is replaced by a table indicating the performance of the
regression model for different values of the probability threshold. The performance measures included
are sensitivity (SN, ratio of positive hairpins classified as miRNAs), specificity (SP, ratio of negative
hairpins classified as non-miRNAs), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), false discovery rate (FDR,
ratio of miRNA predictions that are negative hairpins) and genome prediction rate (GPR, fraction of hairpins
in a genome classified as miRNAs). Output from this mode is written to the benchmark folder instead of step_5.

For C<retrain> mode, a new regression model file is created, containing the coefficients of the model fit
to the training datasets. This model can be used to classify hairpins by supplying the file to the C<-r> option.
Output from this mode is written to the retrain folder instead of step_5.

=head2 EXAMPLE

To test GenoScan following installation, navigate to the t/ folder and type

C<perl genoscan.pl -v -d fake_genome -o output>

This will run GenoScan in genome mode on a fake genome sequence, composed of random sequences concatenated with
sequences from the positive and negative datasets. The result files are written to the output folder and
organized into five sub-folders. The first folder (step_1) contains inclusion and exclusion filters, based on
the sequence annotation supplied (if any). The second folder contains sequence windows derived from the genomic
sequence. These are located in the chunk folder and are organized into chunks, with 50 000 windows per file (maximum).
The windows are folded with RNAfold and the folds are placed in the folded directory. In step 3, hairpins are extracted
from the folded windows and written to step_3 in the output folder. Extracted hairpins are then refolded, visualized
in ASCII format and annotated based on their secondary structure. The annotated hairpins are used by the logistic
regression model to classify the hairpins, and the result from the model is written to the log_reg_model_report file
in the step_4 folder. Finally, hairpins that pass the probability and low-complexity thresholds qualify as miRNA
candidates and are written to the miRNA_candidates.fasta file in step_5. In addition, a summary of the Genoscan run is
written to the genoscan_log file.
